# Introduction
📊 This project analyzes manufacturing defects to uncover patterns in defect types ⚡, severity levels 🚦, and inspection methods 🔍. Using Power BI 💻, I built an interactive dashboard to visualize repair costs 💰, defect distribution 📈, and quality control efficiency ✅. The goal is to provide clear insights for improving production quality 🏭 and reducing repair expenses 📉.
