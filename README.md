# Introduction
---

📊 This project analyzes manufacturing defects to uncover patterns in defect types ⚡, severity levels 🚦, and inspection methods 🔍.  
Using Power BI 💻, I built an interactive dashboard to visualize repair costs 💰, defect distribution 📈, and quality control efficiency ✅.  
The goal is to provide clear insights for improving production quality 🏭 and reducing repair expenses 📉.
