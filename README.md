# Introduction
📊 This project analyzes manufacturing defects to uncover patterns in defect types ⚡, severity levels 🚦, and inspection methods 🔍.  
Using Power BI 💻, I built an interactive dashboard to visualize repair costs 💰, defect distribution 📈, and quality control efficiency ✅.  
The goal is to provide clear insights for improving production quality 🏭 and reducing repair expenses 📉.

# Background
### The questions I wanted to answer through this project were:
1. What is the distribution of defects across the different defect types?
2. What is the distribution of defects across the different defect locations?
3. What is the distribution of defects across the different severity levels?
4. What is the total number of defects?
5. What is the total number of defective products?
6. What is the total repair cost?
7. What is the repair cost by severity level?
8. What is the repair cost by defect type?
9. What is the repair cost by inspection method?
# Tools I used
For my analysis of manufacturing defects, I harnessed the power of several key tools:
- **Kaggle**: The source of my raw dataset, providing real-world manufacturing defect data to work with.
- **Microsoft Excel**: My workspace for cleaning and preparing the data, ensuring consistency and accuracy before analysis.
- **Power BI**: The powerhouse for creating interactive dashboards and visualizations, transforming raw numbers into actionable insights.
