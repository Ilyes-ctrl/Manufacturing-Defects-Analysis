# Introduction
üìä This project analyzes manufacturing defects to uncover patterns in defect types ‚ö°, severity levels üö¶, and inspection methods üîç.  
Using Power BI üíª, I built an interactive dashboard to visualize repair costs üí∞, defect distribution üìà, and quality control efficiency ‚úÖ.  
The goal is to provide clear insights for improving production quality üè≠ and reducing repair expenses üìâ.

# Background
### The questions I wanted to answer through this project were:
1. What is the distribution of defects across the different defect types?
2. What is the distribution of defects across the different defect locations?
3. What is the distribution of defects across the different severity levels?
4. What is the total number of defects?
5. What is the total number of defective products?
6. What is the total repair cost?
7. What is the repair cost by severity level?
8. What is the repair cost by defect type?
9. What is the repair cost by inspection method?
# Tools I used
For my analysis of manufacturing defects, I harnessed the power of several key tools:
- **Kaggle**: The source of my raw dataset, providing real-world manufacturing defect data to work with.
- **Microsoft Excel**: My workspace for cleaning and preparing the data, ensuring consistency and accuracy before analysis.
- **Power BI**: The powerhouse for creating interactive dashboards and visualizations, transforming raw numbers into actionable insights.
# The Analysis
Each visualization in this project was designed to answer a specific business question about manufacturing defects. Here's how I approached it:
## 1. What is the distribution of defects across the different defect types?
To assess the distribution of product defects, I created a stacked column chart in Power BI. The visualization plots the number of defects on the Y-axis and categorizes them by defect type (Structural, Functional, and Cosmetic) on the X-axis. Data labels were enabled to provide precise counts, and the chart was titled "Defects by Type" for clarity. This representation allows for a straightforward comparison across categories and highlights which defect types are most prevalent.
### Insights
The analysis shows that the majority of defects are Structural (352 cases), followed closely by Functional defects (339 cases) and Cosmetic defects (309 cases). While the distribution is relatively balanced, structural issues represent the largest share, suggesting that improvements in structural quality control could have the most significant impact on reducing overall defect rates.

## 2. What is the distribution of defects across the different defect locations?
In order to analyze the distribution of defects by location, I created the following Treemap. The category field was set to Defect Location, distinguishing between surface, component, and internal defects, while the values field was set to Defects to represent their frequency. This visualization makes it easier to compare the relative occurrence of each defect type.
### Insights
The Treemap shows that surface defects are the most frequent, with 353 occurrences, slightly higher than component defects at 326 and internal defects at 321. While surface issues stand out as the largest category, the relatively small gap between the three suggests that defects are fairly evenly distributed across locations, with no single area overwhelmingly dominant.

*The treemap presents the categories surface, component, and internal, each represented by a proportional area corresponding to its number of defects.*

## 3. What is the distribution of defects across the different severity levels?
To analyze the distribution of defect severity levels, I created three gauge visualizations in Power BI. Each gauge is dedicated to one severity category: Minor Defects, Moderate Defects, and Critical Defects. For each category, I defined a specific DAX measure that counts the number of defects falling into that severity group using the `CALCULATE` and `COUNTROWS` functions. For instance, the Minor Defects gauge is driven by the measure `Minor Defects = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('defects_data'),'defects_data'[severity] = "Minor")` while the other two gauges follow the same logic with "Moderate" and "Critical" as filters. To provide context for the gauge scale, I set the minimum value to the lowest "defect_id" and the maximum value to the highest "defect_id", ensuring that each gauge is aligned with the dataset‚Äôs overall defect range. This approach allows for a clear and immediate visualization of how many defects of each severity level are present relative to the dataset.

### Insights
The three gauges provide a distribution of product defects by severity level out of a total of 1,000 defective products. The Minor Defects gauge indicates 358 cases, representing 35.8% of the total. The Moderate Defects gauge shows 309 cases, accounting for 30.9%. The Critical Defects gauge highlights 333 cases, corresponding to 33.3%. This balanced distribution reveals that defects are spread relatively evenly across severity levels, with minor defects being slightly more frequent, while critical defects remain a significant portion, underscoring the need for prioritization in addressing higher-severity issues.

## 4 - 5 - 6. What is the total number of defects, defective products & the total repair cost?
I developed three card visualizations to highlight key performance indicators (KPIs). The first card, Total Defects, presents the overall count of defect IDs recorded in the dataset. The second card, Total Defective Products, reflects the distinct number of products affected by defects. The third card, Total Cost of Repairs, represents the aggregate repair expenses derived from the repair cost data.

### Insights
The KPIs provide a clear overview of the production quality and financial impact of defects. The Total Defects value of 1,000 indicates a significant number of individual defects across all products. The Total Defective Products count of 100 shows that these defects are concentrated across a relatively small number of products, suggesting multiple defects per item. The Total Cost of Repairs, amounting to $507,630, highlights the substantial financial burden associated with addressing these defects, emphasizing the importance of targeted quality control measures to reduce both defect frequency and repair expenses.
